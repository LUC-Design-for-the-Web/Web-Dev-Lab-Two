## Directions

Navigate to the Brookfield Zoo website and complete the following steps below.  Make sure to validate, implement good coding practices and include the mandatory meta tags we discussed in class.

## Steps:

1. **Wireframing:** Create a high-fidelity wire-frame of [Brookfield Zoo] (https://www.czs.org/Brookfield-ZOO/Home) homepage using Adobe XD.
 - Prioritize the site's content by determining of how much space to allocate to a given item and where that item is located.
 - Visualize structure and formation of how content will be presented.
 - Use graphics and color scheme presented within the Brookfield Zoo website to craft your wire-frame.  Your wire-frame should look similar to the actual site.

2. **Usability:** Provide 2 specific recommendations for improving the site performance as it relates to how fast the homepage renders in the browser.  Please refer to the slides on some of the tools you can use to assess site speed.

3.  **Accessibility:** Provide 2 specific recommendations for improving the accessibility of the site.  Consider using the WAVE accessibility tool to determine recommendations.


## End Result

Include each of the following steps above into a HTML document called lab2.html.  Export the wire-frames from AdobeXD as a image and include within the HTML document.  Steps 2 and 3 content should be formatted and structured within your HTML document.  Also, please include the AdobeXD (extension .xd) file within your lab2 folder structure when submitting your lab.

## Submission and Publishing your lab

Your project folder will need to be submitted in 2 different ways.  You will need to submit a zipped folder containing your sites files to canvas before the due date and time listed.  You will also need to upload your lab to the Github repository you accepted.   Please include all images or files that may accompany your assignment within a hierarchical folder structure.
